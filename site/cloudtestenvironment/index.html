Building Sandcastles in the Clouds

A test environment is an ephemeral thing.  It's always in flux.  New code is pushed regularly.  Requirements change unpredictably.  And test data is unreliable at best.  

If you're like most, your test enviroment is at best a poor reflection of production.  It's never stable, and constantly shifting.  And you've only got one.

But the amount of work needed to create a useable test environment can be daunting.  There are hardware resources to allocate, environment configuration dependencies, security concerns, and deployment hurdles to overcome.  




Do you wish you could...

Create a stable test environment that is more like production?

Deploy code to test more frequently and reliably?

Have immediate feedback on automated regression and smoke tests?

Spin up a temporary copy of your app/site to explore radical changes and get customer feedback?
