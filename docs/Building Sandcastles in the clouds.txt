Building Sandcastles in the Clouds

A test environment is an ephemeral thing.  It's always in flux.  New code is pushed regularly.  Requirements change unpredictably.  And test data is unreliable at best.  

If you're like most, your test enviroment is at best a poor reflection of production.  It's never stable.  It is constantly shifting beneath your feet.  And you've only got one. 

But the amount of work needed to create a useable test environment can be daunting.  There are hardware resources to allocate, environment configuration dependencies, security concerns, and deployment hurdles to overcome.  

Continuous Delivery seems like a pipe dream.  Releases can turn into nightmares.  Agile is not delivering on it's promise of faster development.

It can be better.  Sometimes you just need another buzzword.  And a bit of experience.

We can help you building test environments in the cloud.
